Todo
 - maybe try to test all the IPs before showing
 - use gupnp to punch NATs, show that IP as  well
 - upload functionality (a web form for uploading)

Possible options to add:
 - manually select interface
     Not sure when this would be needed...
 - manually select port
     port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports
 - "stop sharing after 1 download"
 - "share in local network / share on internet" if using gupnp
