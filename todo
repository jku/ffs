 - use gupnp-igd to punch NATs. If an igd is present, only show that
   IP by default (maybe add a "share in local network only" option)
 - only show URIs after they have been confirmed with confirm_uri()
 - try to make informed guesses on what is an "internet" ip and
   what is in the local network:
    IANA private networks:
      10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
      172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
      192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    IANA carrier grade NAT:
      100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255
   Alternatively, could just guess that any ipv4 address that is not
   from gupnp-igd is in the local network...
 - upload functionality (a web form for uploading)
 - share a whole directory:
   Probably best to zip/bzip it up (like woof does), but it would be possible to
   use a directory listing (like soup simple-httpd does)
     "7z -y -tzip -bd -mx=9 a $TEMPDIR/shared-dir.zip -- shared-dir"
 - Need a name for this thing...

Possible options to add:
 - manually select the interface/IP
     Not sure when this would be needed.
 - manually select port
     Port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports.
     Maybe could just try some random ports first, then 8080 and 80?
     Should add CLI option for port in any case
 - "stop sharing after a successful download"
 - "share in local network / share on internet" option if using upnp NAT punching
