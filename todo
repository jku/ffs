TODO: UI
 - probably need to show local ip as well when upnp-igd is used:
   should try to make clear what is a local address and what is "internet"
   
TODO: bugs
 - allow selecting directories somehow
 - gupnp-igd error signal handler crashes (fixed in gupnp-igd master)
 - confirm_uri() should have a timeout to set state to "unavailable"

Possible options to add:
 - manually select port
     Port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports.
     Maybe could just try some random ports first, then 8080 and 80?
 - "stop sharing after file has been downloaded"
 - "share only on local network"
