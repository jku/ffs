TODO: UI
 - try to make informed guesses on what is an "internet" ip and
   what is in the local network:
    IANA private networks:
      10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
      172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
      192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    IANA carrier grade NAT:
      100.64.0.0 - 100.127.255.255
   Alternatively, could just guess that any ipv4 address that is not
   from gupnp-igd is in the local network...

TODO: bugs
 - fix the god-awful get_form-function
 - allow selecting directories somehow
 - gupnp-igd error signal handler crashes (fixed in gupnp-igd master)
 - confirm_uri() should have a timeout to set state to "unavailable"
 - handle SharedFileState.BROKEN in UI

Possible options to add:
 - manually select port
     Port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports.
     Maybe could just try some random ports first, then 8080 and 80?
 - "stop sharing after file has been downloaded"
 - "share only on local network"
