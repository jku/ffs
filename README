ffs - Friendly File Server

ffs is a desktop file serving application for quick,
zero-cofiguration file sharing in the local network or on the internet.

ffs is a tool for moving files from computer to computer -- just
easier than using a usb disk, or by sending them over email.

ffs is _not_ a substitute for a real file/web server: If you need
samba, install samba.


Dependencies:
 * python
 * libsoup
 * GTK+
 * GUPnPIgd
 * avahi

Suggested:
 * 7z (For sharing multiple files as a zip archive)
