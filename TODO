TODO: UI
 - should try to explain what is a local address and what is "internet"
 - maybe a "copy URL to clipboard" button
 - maybe ajaxify some bits:
   - could maybe trigger the download GET with a XHR so a reload
     afterwards wouldn't be confusing
   - upload experience sucks like it does everywhere: could
     change the upload_info_part with js to say at least
     "Uploading your file, please wait..."

TODO: bugs
 - allow selecting directories somehow.
   Apparently this is only possible with separate buttons. WTF.
 - gupnp-igd error signal handler crashes
   This is at least somewhat fixed in gupnp-igd master
 - confirm_uri() should maybe have a timeout to re-test a few times
   and to set state to "unavailable" at some point. Also UI should 
   react to it in some way. This relates to "manual port selection"
   as well...
 - Upload directory should be better... maybe a single directory for
   the app, then directory per day if an upload happens?

Possible options to add:
 - manually select port
     Port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports.
     Maybe could just try some random ports first, then 8080 and 80?
     Problem is, how to decide when a port doesn't work? if it doesn't
     answer in X seconds?
 - "stop sharing after file has been up/downloaded"
 - "share only on local network"
