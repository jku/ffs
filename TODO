TODO: UI
 - should try to explain what is a local address and what is "internet"
 - could ajaxify some bits:
   - upload experience sucks like it does everywhere: could
     change the upload_info_part with js to say at least
     "Uploading your file, please wait..."
   - could maybe trigger the POST with a XHR so a reload
     afterwards wouldn't be confusing
 - Should have some info selecting multiple files and dirs, either
   in the UI or in the file chooser dialog

TODO: bugs
 - allow selecting directories somehow.
   Apparently this is only possible with separate buttons. WTF.
 - gupnp-igd error signal handler crashes
   This is at least somewhat fixed in gupnp-igd master
 - confirm_uri() should maybe have a timeout to set state to "unavailable"
   and UI should react to it in some way

Possible options to add:
 - manually select port
     Port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports.
     Maybe could just try some random ports first, then 8080 and 80?
 - "stop sharing after file has been up/downloaded"
 - "share only on local network"
