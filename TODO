TODO: UI
 - should try to explain what is a local address and what is "internet"
 - maybe ajaxify some bits:
   - could maybe trigger the download GET with a XHR so a reload
     afterwards wouldn't be confusing
   - upload experience sucks like it does everywhere: could
     change the upload_info_part with js to say at least
     "Uploading your file, please wait..."
 - Should have some info selecting multiple files and dirs, either
   in the UI or in the file chooser dialog

TODO: bugs
 - allow selecting directories somehow.
   Apparently this is only possible with separate buttons. WTF.
 - gupnp-igd error signal handler crashes
   This is at least somewhat fixed in gupnp-igd master
 - confirm_uri() should maybe have a timeout to re-test a few times
   and to set state to "unavailable" at some point. Also UI should 
   react to it in some way. This relates to "manual port selection"
   as well...

Possible options to add:
 - manually select port
     Port should be autoselected, but some ISPs block non-standard ports.
     Maybe could just try some random ports first, then 8080 and 80?
 - "stop sharing after file has been up/downloaded"
 - "share only on local network"
